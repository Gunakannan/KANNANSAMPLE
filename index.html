         <h1>About:</h1><br>A fast-growing urban conglomerate, yet a land where you can slow down, enjoying the innate beauty of the destination. Here is a city where you get to enjoy it all – history, leisure, culture, cuisine and what not.
         Surrounded by hills and a landscape dotted with hillocks, Salem district is a paradise for nature lovers, trekkers and eco-tourists.  It is divided into Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Namakkal as individual districts. The word Salem is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Sailam’ meaning cradled among hills. These hills were an impetus to the industrial thrust of Salem in the 20th century. 
         
         The region is famous for cultivation of mangoes and the special variety called Malgoa is the pride of Salem besides a number of other newly introduced hybrid varieties. Tapioca locally known as Maravalli (or) Kuchi Kilangu is extensively cultivated by the farmers of Salem. The slopes of Yercaud hills are covered with vast plantations of coffee, shaded by silver Oak trees. Narasus coffee, a popular brand, has its origin in Salem. 
         
         The district is rich in mineral deposits such as Magnesite, Bauxite, Granite, Limestone, Quartz and Iron ore. Allied industries like magnesite mining, cement manufacture, refractory bricks manufacture, aluminum smelting thrive well in this area. The Salem handloom industry is one of the ancient cottage industries, producing quality sarees and dhoties out of silk yarn and cotton yarn. 
         
         Yercaud is a popular hill station in Salem, quite inexpensive yet exquisitely picturesque. The cool and mild climate prevailing here makes it an ideal summer retreat. The Shervarayan temple which is inside a narrow cavern with a rivulet rippling behind the idols is one of the main spots of tourist attraction in the district. The flowering of ‘Kurunji’ once in twelve years also attracts tourists. Coffee, spices like cardamom, pepper, fruits like “Kamala” Orange, butter fruit, Jack fruit are grown in Yercaud and find good markets. Yercaud houses many colonial buildings and churches. The prestigious residential school “The Mont fort School” is at Yercaud.
